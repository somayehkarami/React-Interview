//A Promise is in one of these states:

//pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
//fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
//rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

//If present, effect will only activate if the values in the list change.[]
//Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.

//Why and When To Use Custom Hooks *************
//The main reason to write a custom hook is for code reusability.
//For example, instead of writing the same code across multiple components
// that use the same common stateful logic (say a “setState” or localStorage logic),
//you can put that code inside a custom hook and reuse it.

//null evaluates to false
